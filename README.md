# cross platform ui library

## long term goals

- run on anything the backend wgpu can run on
- create ui code that is simple and easily correct

## short term goals

- create a few rectangles of different colors, that changes a common rectangle to its color when clicked
    - this should set up the backbone for more complex message passing
